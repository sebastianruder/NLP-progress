Semantic parsing is the task of translating natural language into a formal meaning
representation on which a machine can act. Representations may be an executable language
such as SQL or more abstract representations such as [Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Meaning_Representation)
and [Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA)](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend/ucca.html).

## AMR parsing

Each AMR is a single rooted, directed graph. AMRs include PropBank semantic roles, within-sentence coreference, named entities and types, modality, negation, questions, quantities, and so on. [See](https://amr.isi.edu/index.html).
In the following tables, systems marked with &hearts; are pipeline systems that require POS as input,
&spades; is for those require NER,
&diams; is for those require syntax parsing,
and &clubs; is for those require SRL.

### LDC2014T12:
The dataset contains 13,051 AMRs split across training, dev, and test partitions.

Models are evaluated on the newswire section and the full dataset based on [smatch](https://amr.isi.edu/smatch-13.pdf).

## DRS parsing

Discourse Representation Structures (DRS) are formal meaning representations introduced by [Discourse Representation Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_representation_theory). DRS parsing is a complex task, comprising other NLP tasks, such as semantic role labeling, word sense disambiguation, co-reference resolution and named entity tagging. Also, DRSs show explicit scope for certain operators, which allows for a more principled and linguistically motivated treatment of negation, modals and quantification, as has been advocated in formal semantics. Moreover, DRSs can be translated to formal logic, which allows for automatic forms of inference by third parties.

### Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB)

The results listed here are from annotated English DRSs released by the [Parallel Meaning Bank](pmb.let.rug.nl). An introduction of the PMB and the annotation process is described in [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E17-2039.pdf). A DRS consists of a list of clauses. Each clause contains a number of variables, which are matched during evaluation using the evaluation tool Counter ([paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1267.pdf), [code](https://github.com/RikVN/DRS_parsing)). Counter calculates an F-score over the matching clauses for each DRS-pair and micro-averages these to calculate a final F-score, similar to the Smatch procedure of AMR parsing.

The scores listed here are for PMB release [2.2.0](https://pmb.let.rug.nl/data.php) and [3.0.0](https://pmb.let.rug.nl/data.php), specifically. The development and test sets differ per release, but have a considerable overlap. The results listed here are on the test set. The data sets can be downloaded on the official [PMB webpage](https://pmb.let.rug.nl/data.php), but note that a more user-friendly format can be downloaded by following the steps in the [Neural_DRS repository](https://github.com/RikVN/Neural_DRS).

#### PMB-2.2.0

The gold standard train, dev and test sets contain 4,597, 682 and 650 documents, respectively.

### RST-DT

RST-DT [(Carlson et al., 2001)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W01-1605.pdf) contains 385 documents of American English selected from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), annotated in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory.
The dataset was officially divided into 347 documents as the training dataset and 38 documents as the test dataset. Note that there is no officially available development dataset.
In the evaluation, micro-averaged F1 scores of unlabeled spans (Span), those of nuclearity labeled spans (Nuclearity), those of rhetorical relation labeled spans (Relation), and those of both nuclearity and rhetorical relation labeled spans (Full) based on RST-Parseval [(Marcu 2000)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/theory-and-practice-discourse-parsing-and-summarization) are used. An implementation of the standard evaluation metrics is [here](http://alt.qcri.org/tools/discourse-eval/).

## UCCA parsing

UCCA ([Abend and Rappoport, 2013](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P13-1023.pdf))
is a semantic representation whose main design principles
are ease of annotation, cross-linguistic applicability, and a modular architecture. UCCA represents
the semantics of linguistic utterances as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where terminal (childless)
nodes correspond to the text tokens, and non-terminal nodes to semantic units that participate in
some super-ordinate relation. Edges are labeled,
indicating the role of a child in the relation the parent represents.
UCCA's foundational layer mostly covers predicate-argument structure,
semantic heads and inter-Scene relations.
UCCA distinguishes primary edges, corresponding to explicit relations, from remote edges
that allow for a unit to participate in several super-ordinate relations.
Primary edges form a tree in each layer, whereas remote edges enable reentrancy, forming a DAG.

Evaluation is done by labeled F1 on the graph edges, matched by child terminal yield.

### [SemEval 2019 Task 1](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S19-2001.pdf)

Open and closed tracks on English, French and German [UCCA corpora](https://github.com/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation) from Wikipedia and *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*.
Results for the English open track data are given here, with 5,141 training sentences.

### [CoNLL 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K19-2001.pdf)

The CoNLL 2019 shared task included parsing to AMR, UCCA, DM, PSD, and EDS.
The [UCCA training data](http://svn.nlpl.eu/mrp/2019/public/ucca.tgz) is freely available.

UCCA evaluation is done both by UCCA F1 (as in SemEval 2019) and by the MRP metric, which is similar to smatch.
The training data contains 6,572 sentences from web reviews and Wikipedia.
There are two evaluation sets: one with 1,131, from the same domains (Full), and one with 87 sentences, from *The Little Prince* (LPP). Note that due to an error, 535 of the 1,131 Full Evaluation sentences were included in the training data, and therefore the full evaluation scores are an overestimate. The LPP scores are unaffected by this.

## Semantic Dependency Parsing

Broad-coverage semantic dependency parsing (SDP) [(Oepen et al., 2014)](aclweb.org/anthology/S14-2008) is defined as the task of recovering sentence-internal predicate–argument relationships for all content words, i.e. the semantic structure constituting the relational core of sentence meaning.  Target representations, thus, are semantic dependency graphs, as shown in our running example for the (Wall Street Journal) sentence:

```
A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans, and rice.
```
 Here, ‘technique’ for example, is the argument of at least the determiner (as the quantificational locus), the intersective modifier ‘similar’, and the predicate ‘apply’.  Conversely, the predicative copula, infinitival ‘to’, and the vacuous preposition marking the deep object of ‘apply’ arguably have no semantic contribution of their own.  For general background on the 2014 variant and an overview of participating systems (and results), please see the [(Oepen et al., 2014)](aclweb.org/anthology/S14-2008).
 
 ### [SemEval 2015 Task 18](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task18/)
 
 This Task is a re-run with some extensions of [Task 8 at SemEval 2014](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task8/). The task has three distinct target representations, dubbed DM, PAS, and PSD (renamed from what was PCEDT at SemEval 2014), representing different traditions of semantic annotation. More detail on the linguistic ‘pedigree’ of these formats is available in the [summary](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task18/index.php?id=representations) of target representations, and there is also an [on-line search](http://wesearch.delph-in.net/sdp/) interface available to interactively explore these representations (like the initial release of the training data, this interface in early August 2014 still lacks semantic dependency graphs for languages other than English).

In each dataset, there is a in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) test set. The evaluation metric is the labeled F1 score.
