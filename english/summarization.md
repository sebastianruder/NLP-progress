# Summarization

Summarization is the task of producing a shorter version of one or several documents that preserves most of the
input's meaning.

### Warning: Evaluation Metrics

For summarization, automatic metrics such as ROUGE and METEOR have serious limitations:
1. They only assess content selection and do not account for other quality aspects, such as fluency, grammaticality, coherence, etc. 
2. To assess content selection, they rely mostly on lexical overlap, although an abstractive summary could express they same content as a reference without any lexical overlap.
3. Given the subjectiveness of summarization and the correspondingly low agreement between annotators, the metrics were designed to be used with multiple reference summaries per input. However, recent datasets such as CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword provide only a single reference.

Therefore, tracking progress and claiming state-of-the-art based only on these metrics is questionable. Most papers carry out additional manual comparisons of alternative summaries. Unfortunately, such experiments are difficult to compare across papers. If you have an idea on how to do that, feel free to contribute.


### CNN / Daily Mail

The [CNN / Daily Mail dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03340) as processed by 
[Nallapati et al. (2016)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K16-1028) has been used
for evaluating summarization. The dataset contains online news articles (781 tokens 
on average) paired with multi-sentence summaries (3.75 sentences or 56 tokens on average).
The processed version contains 287,226 training pairs, 13,368 validation pairs and 11,490 test pairs.
Models are evaluated with full-length F1-scores of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and METEOR (optional).
The multilingual version of CNN / Daily Mail dataset exists and is available for five different languages ([French](../french/summarization.md#mlsum), [German](../german/summarization.md#mlsum), [Spanish](../spanish/summarization.md#mlsum), [Russian](../russian/summarization.md#mlsum), [Turkish](../turkish/summarization.md#mlsum)).

### Gigaword

The Gigaword summarization dataset has been first used by [Rush et al., 2015](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D15/D15-1044.pdf) and represents a sentence summarization / headline generation task with very short input documents (31.4 tokens) and summaries (8.3 tokens). It contains 3.8M training, 189k development and 1951 test instances. Models are evaluated with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L using full-length F1-scores.

### X-Sum

X-Sum (standing for _Extreme Summarization_), introduced by [Narayan et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08745.pdf), is a summarization dataset which does not favor extractive strategies and calls for an abstractive modeling approach.  
The idea of this dataset is to create a short, one sentence news summary.  
Data is collected by harvesting online articles from the BBC.  
The dataset contain **204 045** samples for the training set, **11 332** for the validation set, and **11 334** for the test set. In average the length of article is 431 words (~20 sentences) and the length of summary is 23 words. It can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/XSum).  
Evaluation metrics are ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L.

### DUC 2004 Task 1

Similar to Gigaword, task 1 of [DUC 2004](https://duc.nist.gov/duc2004/) is a sentence summarization task. The dataset contains 500 documents with on average 35.6 tokens and summaries with 10.4 tokens. Due to its size, neural models are typically trained on other datasets and only tested on DUC 2004. Evaluation metrics are ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L recall @ 75 bytes.

## Webis-TLDR-17 Corpus

This [dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1168855) contains 3 Million pairs of content and self-written summaries mined from Reddit. It is one of the first large-scale summarization dataset from the social media domain. For more details, refer to [TL;DR: Mining Reddit to Learn Automatic Summarization](https://aclweb.org/anthology/W17-4508)

## Webis-Snippet-20 Corpus
This [dataset](https://webis.de/data/webis-snippet-20.html) contains approximately 10 Million (webpage content, abstractive snippet) pairs and 3.5 Million (query term, webpage content, abstractive snippet) triples for the novel task of (query-biased) abstractive snippet generation of web pages. The corpus is compiled from ClueWeb09, ClueWeb12 and the DMOZ Open Directory Project. For more details, refer to [Abstractive Snippet Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10782)

## Sentence Compression

Sentence compression produces a shorter sentence by removing redundant information,
preserving the grammatically and the important content of the original sentence. 

### Google Dataset

The [Google Dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/sentence-compression) was built by Filippova et al., 2013([Overcoming the Lack of Parallel Data in Sentence Compression](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1155.pdf)). The first dataset released contained only 10,000 sentence-compression pairs, but last year was released an additional 200,000 pairs. 

Example of a sentence-compression pair:
> Sentence: Floyd Mayweather is open to fighting Amir Khan in the future, despite snubbing the Bolton-born boxer in favour of a May bout with Argentine Marcos Maidana, according to promoters Golden Boy

> Compression: Floyd Mayweather is open to fighting Amir Khan in the future. 

In short, this is a deletion-based task where the compression is a subsequence from the original sentence. From the 10,000 pairs of the eval portion([repository](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/sentence-compression/tree/master/data)) it is used the very first 1,000 sentence for automatic evaluation and the 200,000 pairs for training.

Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
* F1 - compute the recall and precision in terms of tokens kept in the golden and the generated compressions.
* Compression rate (CR) - the length of the compression in characters divided over the sentence length.
