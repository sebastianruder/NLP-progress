# Combinatory Categorical Grammar

Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG; [Steedman, 2000](http://www.citeulike.org/group/14833/article/8971002)) is a
highly lexicalized formalism. The standard parsing model of [Clark and Curran (2007)](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/coli.2007.33.4.493)
uses over 400 lexical categories (or _supertags_), compared to about 50 part-of-speech tags for typical parsers.

Example:

| Vinken | , | 61 | years | old |
| --- | ---| --- | --- | --- |
| N| , | N/N | N | (S[adj]\ NP)\ NP |

## Parsing

CCG parsing is evaluated in terms of labeled dependency F-score, which "take\[s\] into account the lexical category containing the dependency relation, the argument slot, the word associated with the lexical category, and the argument head word: All four must be correct to score a point" ([Clark & Curran, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli.2007.33.4.493)).
Besides the word forms, some popular parsers (like the C&C parser) take POS tags as input. For fair comparison, systems should use automatically obtained POS as input, though some papers additionally report performance with oracle gold-standard POS features.

### CCGBank

The CCGBank is a corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn Treebank by
[Hockenmaier and Steedman (2007)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J07-3004). Sections 2-21 are used for training,
section 00 for development, and section 23 as in-domain test set.

## Supertagging

To mitigate sparsity, CCG supertaggers have traditionally been trained only on categories that occur 10 times or more in the CCGBank training data, which amounts to the 425 most frequent categories. In more recent work, using this threshold is becoming less common. In any case, supertagging evaluation is always measured for all supertags occurring in the test set. Models are evaluated based on token accuracy.

### Constructive supertagging

A constructive tagger models the internal structure of supertags rather than treating each supertag type as opaque ([Kogkalidis et al., 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4314/)). Supertags are constructed from minimal pieces (which for CCG are slashes and atomic categories) and there is no frequency cutoff.

## Conversion to PTB

There has been interest in converting CCG derivations to phrase structure parses for comparison with phrase structure parsers (since CCGBank is based on the PTB).
