# Vietnamese NLP tasks

## Dependency parsing

* Experiments employ the [benchmark Vietnamese dependency treebank VnDT](http://vndp.sourceforge.net) of 10K+ sentences, using  1,020 sentences for test, 200 sentences for development and the remaining sentences for training. LAS and UAS scores are computed on all tokens (i.e. including punctuation).

## Named entity recognition
### VLSP
* 16,861 sentences for training and development from the VLSP 2016 NER shared task:
  *  14,861 sentences are used for training.
  *  2k sentences are used for development.
* Test data: 2,831 test sentences from the VLSP 2016 NER  shared task.
* **NOTE** that in the VLSP 2016 NER data, each word representing a full personal name are separated into syllables that constitute the word. The VLSP 2016 NER data also consists of gold POS and chunking tags as [reconfirmed by VLSP 2016 organizers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XzrgPw13N4C_B6yrQy_7qIxl8Bqf7Uqi/view?usp=sharing). This scheme results in an unrealistic scenario for a pipeline evaluation: 
  * The standard annotation for Vietnamese word segmentation and POS tagging forms each full name as a word token, thus all   word segmenters have been trained to output a full name as a word and all POS taggers have been trained to assign a POS label to the entire full-name.
  * Gold POS and chunking tags are NOT available in a real-world application.
* For a realistic scenario, contiguous syllables constituting a full name are merged to form a word. POS/chunking tags--if used--have to be automatically predicted!
